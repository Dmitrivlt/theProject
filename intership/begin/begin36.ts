// Begin36. The velocity of the first car is V1 km/h, the velocity of the second car is V2 km/h, the initial distance between the cars is S km. Find the distance between the cars after T hours provided that the distance is increasing. The required distance is equal to a sum of the initial distance and the total distance covered by the both cars (total distance = time Â· total velocity).

const v1 = 46;
const v2 = 35;
let s = 3;
let t = 2
console.log(s + v1 * t + v2 * t)
